What is Energy?
Energy is the ability to do work. Every action we perform, from walking to powering machines, requires energy. In daily life, we use energy to light homes, run vehicles, cook food, and operate industries.
Forms of Energy:
Energy exists in several forms:
Mechanical Energy – energy in motion or stored due to position.
Heat (Thermal) Energy – energy due to the movement of particles.
Electrical Energy – energy carried by electric currents.
Chemical Energy – stored in fuels and food.
Nuclear Energy – released from atomic reactions.
Light (Solar) Energy – comes from the Sun.
Sources of Energy:
Energy sources can be divided into two main types:
Non-Renewable Energy Sources
These sources take millions of years to form and cannot be quickly replaced.
Examples:
Coal
Petroleum
Natural gas
Disadvantages:
They pollute the environment.
They are limited and will eventually run out.
Renewable Energy Sources
These sources are naturally replenished and do not get exhausted easily.
Examples:
Solar Energy: Energy from the Sun
Wind Energy: Energy from moving air
Hydropower: Energy from flowing water
Biomass: Energy from plant and animal waste
Geothermal Energy: Heat from inside the Earth
Benefits of Renewable Energy:
Environmentally friendly (low pollution)
Sustainable and long-lasting
Reduces dependence on fossil fuels
Helps fight climate change
Challenges of Renewable Energy:
Requires high initial cost for setup (e.g., solar panels)
Energy availability may depend on weather (e.g., sunlight, wind)
Why Renewable Energy is Important:
As fossil fuels become depleted and pollution increases, renewable energy offers a clean and sustainable solution for powering our future. Many countries are increasing investments in renewable energy to ensure energy security and reduce environmental damage.
